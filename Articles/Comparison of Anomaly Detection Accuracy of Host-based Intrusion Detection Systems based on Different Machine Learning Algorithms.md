• Summary: This paper investigates the effectiveness of various machine learning algorithms
in improving the accuracy of anomaly detection within Host-based Intrusion Detection
Systems (HIDS).
• HIDS and Anomaly Detection: HIDS monitor a computer system's activities for
suspicious behavior. Anomaly detection, a technique used by HIDS, identifies
deviations from normal system patterns potentially indicating an intrusion attempt.
• Machine Learning and Improvement: The paper explores how different machine
learning algorithms can be used to analyze system data and enhance the accuracy of
anomaly detection in HIDS.
• Evaluation: The authors likely compare the performance of various machine learning
algorithms on a dataset containing normal and attack-related system activities. They
would then analyze which algorithm achieves the most accurate detection of
anomalies.
• Potential Algorithm: The ADFA-LD dataset is a common benchmark for evaluating
HIDS. The paper might explore algorithms suitable for analyzing system calls within
this dataset.
Overall, this paper sheds light on how machine learning can be leveraged to strengthen
anomaly detection in HIDS, potentially leading to more robust intrusion prevention.
