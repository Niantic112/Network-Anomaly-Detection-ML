• Summary: The paper "Analysis of error-based machine learning algorithms in network
anomaly detection and categorization" by Ajila, Lung, and Das investigates the effectiveness
of various machine learning algorithms for identifying and classifying network anomalies.
Their goal is to find the algorithm that offers the highest accuracy and fastest training times.
The authors focus on error-based learning models, including Winnow, Logistic Regression,
Perceptron, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Deep Learning. They evaluate these
algorithms within a two-stage framework designed to detect anomalies and then categorize
them. The findings suggest that the Winnow algorithm achieved the best overall
performance with 100% accuracy and a training time of 0.47 seconds for anomaly
detection.
It is important to note that the paper concentrates on error-based learning, and it compares
these results with non-error-based algorithms as well.
