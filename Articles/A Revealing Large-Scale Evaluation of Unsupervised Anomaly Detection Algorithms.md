• Summary: This is an article about evaluating unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms. It
discusses the challenges of choosing an algorithm for a specific application. The authors
identify inconsistencies in how these algorithms are evaluated. They propose a new
evaluation protocol to compare twelve different algorithms on five datasets. This allows for
a more precise picture of how these algorithms perform. The article does not claim that one
algorithm outperforms all others, but it highlights which algorithms perform well.
