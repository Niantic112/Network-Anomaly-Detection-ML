• Summary: The article titled "Graph Neural Networks based Log Anomaly Detection and
Explanation," authored by Z. Li, J. Shi, and M. van Leeuwen, presents a novel approach to
log anomaly detection using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Available on
http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00527, the paper introduces a method that leverages the
inherent graph structure of log data to enhance anomaly detection and provide
explanations for detected anomalies.
By utilizing GNNs, the study demonstrates how log data, often characterized by complex
interdependencies and sequences, can be effectively modeled as graphs. This approach
enables the detection of anomalous patterns within logs while also providing
interpretability through the explanation of detected anomalies.
The research contributes to advancing anomaly detection techniques in cybersecurity by
proposing a methodology that not only identifies anomalies in log data but also offers
insights into the reasons behind these anomalies. This dual capability enhances the
effectiveness of anomaly detection systems and aids in the understanding and mitigation of
potential security threats.

• Summary: This is an article about unsupervised log anomaly detection [1]. It discusses a
method called Logs2Graphs that converts event logs into graphs to be used for anomaly
detection. Logs2Graphs uses a specific type of graph neural network model called OCDiGCN
to detect anomalies in the graphs. This method achieves high accuracy and can also provide
explanations for the anomalies it detects. The authors compare their method to other stateof-the-art methods and find that it performs well on both simple and complicated datasets.
