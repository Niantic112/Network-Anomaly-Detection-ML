• Summary: The paper titled "Classification Based Machine Learning for Detection of DDoS
Attack in Cloud Computing," authored by A. Mishra, B. B. Gupta, D. Perakovic, F. J. G.
Penalvo, and C. H. Hsu, investigates the application of classification-based machine learning
techniques for detecting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in cloud computing
environments. Presented in the Digest of Technical Papers - IEEE International Conference
on Consumer Electronics in January 2021, the study explores the effectiveness of various
classification algorithms in identifying and mitigating DDoS attacks within cloud
infrastructures.
Through experimentation and analysis, the paper evaluates the performance of different
machine learning models in distinguishing between normal cloud traffic and malicious DDoS
attacks. It assesses factors such as detection accuracy, false positive rates, and
computational efficiency to determine the suitability of each algorithm for real-world
deployment in cloud environments.
This research contributes to the advancement of DDoS attack detection in cloud computing
by providing insights into the efficacy of classification-based machine learning approaches.
By identifying effective detection strategies, the study offers valuable guidance for
enhancing the security and resilience of cloud infrastructures against DDoS attacks, thereby
safeguarding critical digital assets and services.
